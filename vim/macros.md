# Recording and Using Macros

I constantly forget this and have to look it up :(

## Recording

1. Press `q`, followed by a lower case character to name the macro
1. Perform the actions to record.
1. Press `q` again to stop recording

## Replaying

1. Press `@` followed by the macro name.
1. Apply it multiple times by typing a number before the `@` or by using command mode to do something like: `: 5 @ a` (where `a` is the macro name)
